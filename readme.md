# Hybrid Tools

Hybrid Tools is an add-on package for the Hybrid Core WordPress framework. This package provides necessary tools for the framework.

## Requirements

* WordPress 4.9.6+.
* PHP 5.6+ (7.0+ recommended).
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) for managing PHP dependencies.

The framework is coded to work on PHP 5.6+, but only 7.0+ is officially supported.

## Purchase or donate

Hybrid Core is free.  However, I ask that you purchase a support membership at [Theme Hybrid](https://themehybrid.com).  Even if you don't need support, every purchase helps fund the development of this project.

[Donations to the project](https://themehybrid.com/donate) are also welcome.

## Documentation

The documentation is handled via Hybrid Tools's [wiki](https://github.com/themehybrid/hybrid-tools/wiki).  This is community-contributed documentation that I hope you will add to if you use the framework.

### Installation

Use the following command from your preferred command line utility to install the package.

```bash
composer require themehybrid/hybrid-tools
```
